**Answer:** To store structured/unstructured data for analytics with support from tools like Azure Data Factory and Azure Databricks.

### 5. How do you secure infrastructure in Azure?
**Answer:** With RBAC, Azure AD, Managed Identities, Key Vault, Azure Policy, Defender for Cloud.

### 6. How do you use Terraform in Azure?
**Answer:** Define infrastructure using HCL, manage state in remote backend (e.g., Azure Blob), apply modules, and integrate into CI/CD pipelines.

### 7. What is Azure Monitor?
**Answer:** A unified monitoring solution for metrics, logs, alerts, and visualization via dashboards or tools like Grafana.

### 8. How do you troubleshoot VM connectivity?
**Answer:** Inspect NSGs, routes, DNS resolution, NIC configs, VM boot diagnostics, and Azure Network Watcher logs.

### 9. What is Kusto Query Language (KQL)?
**Answer:** A query language used in Azure Log Analytics to explore and analyze telemetry data.

### 10. Explain ExpressRoute.
**Answer:** A dedicated private connection from on-premise to Azure with higher bandwidth, reliability, and lower latency.

### 11. How do you manage secrets securely?
**Answer:** Store and manage secrets/certs in Azure Key Vault with RBAC and audit logs.

### 12. What are Azure DevOps components?
**Answer:** Repos, Pipelines, Boards, Test Plans, and Artifacts.

### 13. How does a CI/CD pipeline work for IaC?
**Answer:** Triggered from Git commits â†’ run Terraform plan/apply â†’ deploy resources â†’ run post-deploy validation.

### 14. What is observability in cloud?
**Answer:** Ability to measure system health using metrics, logs, traces, and correlate them for root-cause analysis.

### 15. What is Azure AD?
**Answer:** Azureâ€™s identity platform that provides user authentication, SSO, and service principal management.

### 16. Difference between NSG and Azure Firewall?
**Answer:** NSG = basic subnet-level filtering; Firewall = centralized, stateful, L3/L7 traffic inspection.

### 17. What is Infrastructure-as-Code?
**Answer:** Declarative configuration of infrastructure using code to ensure reproducibility and automation.

### 18. What is Azure Databricks?
**Answer:** Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for Azure, used for big data and ML workloads.

### 19. What are ARM templates?
**Answer:** JSON-based Azure-native IaC that can be used for resource provisioning.

### 20. Terraform vs ARM Templates?
**Answer:** Terraform is multi-cloud, uses HCL, more modular; ARM is Azure-native with tighter integration.

---

### 21. What is Azure Logic App?
**Answer:** Low-code workflow orchestration tool for integrating services and automating tasks.

### 22. How do you detect drift in Terraform?
**Answer:** Use `terraform plan` and `terraform refresh` to compare desired and actual state.

### 23. What is Azure Event Hub?
**Answer:** Big data streaming platform and event ingestion service for telemetry pipelines.

### 24. What is Prometheus?
**Answer:** Time-series monitoring system, used with exporters and Grafana for metric visualization.

### 25. How do you ensure high availability in Azure?
**Answer:** Use Availability Zones, load balancers, auto-scaling, and geo-redundant storage.

### 26. NSG vs Firewall use cases?
**Answer:** NSG for internal subnet control; Firewall for centralized threat detection and logging.

**Answer:** AKS for orchestrated workloads, ACI for serverless containers, ACR for registry.

### 32. What is a Service Principal?
**Answer:** An identity used by apps or automation tools to access Azure resources.

### 33. Monitoring strategy for production?
**Answer:** Collect telemetry â†’ set SLIs/SLOs â†’ define alerts â†’ integrate with incident response (e.g., PagerDuty).

### 34. What is Azure Policy?
**Answer:** Governance tool to enforce resource compliance across subscriptions.

### 35. Common Terraform issues?
**Answer:** Drift, remote state locking, duplicate resources. Use backends, `lifecycle`, and proper `depends_on`.
